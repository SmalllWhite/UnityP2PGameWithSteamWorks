Steamworks.NET Example
=======

This is a sample project for [Steamworks.NET](//github.com/rlabrecque/Steamworks.NET) it is intended to show functionality and a potential usage scenario.

It is heavily based upon the Steamworks Example 'SpaceWar' included with the Steamworks SDK. It currently only features the `StatsAndAchievements` class from SpaceWar.

This sample is available in the public domain (where acceptable.) Please view [LICENSE.txt](LICENSE.txt) for more details.

This project was built with Unity 5.5.1. As such it is only expected to build and run without issue on that version or later.
